Scripts
=======

These are linux scripts I wrote and use on my Linux setup daily. Their purpose is to mostly make certain tasks easier or just increase visual feedback on my rather streamlined, minimalist setup.

Parts of the scripts were taken from posts I've seen around the internet, if you'd like your name mentioned as the original writer for some of the code, send me a message and credit shall be given. Please do the same if you use my code as part of yours somewhere else.

As soon as I find some more time I intend to write down all dependencies for each individual script both here and inside them. As well as some basic documentation.

If you have any question regarding how to use them, feel free to ask. But keep in mind they are provided with no guarantees that it will work on your setup out of the box.
